            <h3>A VALIDATION</h3>
            <p> In shadows cast by doubt and fear, <br>
                A child waits, her future unclear. <br>
                Longing for a validation,<br>
                For her worth, her place.<br>
                Each test a battle, hard-fought ground,<br>
                Yet happiness never truly found.<br>
                <br>
                Seeking solace in a letter,<br>
                Hoping it will make her better.<br>
                But grades alone cannot define,<br>
                The brilliance in her heart's design.<br>
                She's more than numbers on a page,<br>
                Her potential, a boundless stage.<br>
                <br>
                So let her know, in gentle voice,<br>
                Her worth transcends a simple choice.<br>
                Encourage her to brightly shine,<br>
                And watch her soar, her spirit fine.</p>

            <h3>FORBIDDEN, THEY SAY!</h3>
            <p> In a hidden place, beneath moonlit skies, <br>
                Two hearts entwine, in each other's eyes.<br>
                Love knows no bounds, in their shared embrace,<br>
                Finding solace and peace in this forbidden space.<br>
                    <br>
                Hand in hand, they defy the norm,<br>
                Their love blossoms, pure and warm.<br>
                Together they stand, unapologetically strong,<br>
                In a world where love can never be wrong.</p>

            <h3>Butterfly</h3>
            <p> A garden bright, a vision takes flight,<br>
                Graceful dancer in the morning light.<br>
                Petals mimic its rainbow hues,<br>
                A fleeting glimpse of nature's muse.<br>
                    <br>
                Silent whispers on zephyrs' wings,<br>
                A delicate secret nature brings.<br>
                In whispered tales of day untold,<br>
                Beauty's dance in colors bold.</p>

            <h3>DELIGHT IN ONE NIGHT</h3>
            <p> Beneath the stars, a young girl wanders free,<br>
                Under the moon's glow, where shadows be.<br>
                Her heart is light, her spirit wild and bright,<br>
                Dancing in the dark, lost in the night.<br>
                    <br>
                Adventure calls, she answers with glee,<br>
                In the shadows, she finds what she seeks to see.<br>
                Just for one night, she lets herself sway,<br>
                In freedom's embrace, she finds her own way.<br>
                    <br>
                Guided by stars, with the wind as her song,<br>
                Living in the moment, where she belongs.<br>
                A memory of a wild night, shining so clear,<br>
                In the soft moonlight, she has nothing to fear. <br>

            <h3>FAITH</h3>
            <p> Love's arrival, a surprise so dear,<br>
                Heart aflutter, thoughts tangled, crystal clear,<br>
                Longing in gazes, treasures to find,<br>
                Daydreams dance, shared space in mind.<br>
                    <br>
                Connection deep, words cannot convey,<br>
                Thrilling journey, hearts in love's sway.<br>
                Embrace the journey, hand in hand,<br>
                In love's embrace, we'll forever stand.<br>
                    <br>
                You had my heart.<br>
                You had my soul.<br>
                You are Faith. </p>
