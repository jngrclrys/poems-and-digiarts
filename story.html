            <h3> I AM A PARADOX </h3>
            <p> Uhm... what's my fave fast food restaurant? Well, it's the McDonalds! Their fries are the best, long and very tasty. But I also love eating Jollibee, especially their crispylicious chicken!</p>

            <h3> I AM A PARADOX </h3>
            <p> Arcades is a very crowded place, full of noisy adults, and children. But, I am one of them! I love playing at the arcades. It is fun!</p>

            <h3> I AM A PARADOX </h3>
            <p> I hate taking pictures of myself. I am not that confident everytime I try to pose. But I like it better how I manage to compliment myself after one shot. I love me.

            <h3> I AM A PARADOX </h3>
            <p> Laag and foodtrips are the best therapy. Eating various of food, visiting various places to unwind but no one can beat the feeling of having an ice cream therapy!</p>

            <h3> I AM A PARADOX </h3>
            <p> I prefer a small circle of friends, with unending support, chikas, and laags but I didn't say that I can't accept a new new. What can I say? I'm a friendly and a talkative freak.</p>
